# A Simple Explaination

## Vector

A Vector is a data structure with 2 coordinate values. These values conclude to other values like their x and y directions and the magnitude.

You can do math operations on vectors like:

- Add
- Subtract
- Scalar Multiplication
- Vector Multiplication
  - Dot
  - Cross

## Canvas

The Canvas library simplifies the Canvas interface provided by the HTML canvas.
This is completely for asthetics/abstraction

You can create:

- circles
- rectangles
- reverse rectangles for bar plots
- paths

## Camera

The Camera library simplifies the Camera interface by handling the video element as well as the video stream from the webcam

---

## Mouse

The Mouse library simplifies the mouse events.

---

## Keyboard

The Keyboard library simplifies Keyboard events.

---

## Geometry

The Geometry library handles concepts like vertices, edges, bodies
